As of this writing, |jurism| is nearing its tenth anniversary. Since
its debut as "Multilingual Zotero," a submission to the `Second CiNii
API Contest
<https://ci.nii.ac.jp/info/ja/web_api_contest_2010_results.html>`_,
the project has chased the `Zotero code base
<https://github.com/zotero/zotero>`_. In 2015, Multilingual Zotero (or
"MLZ") was repackaged as |jurism|, to better reflect its support for
legal as well as multilingual content and referencing.

To the extent possible, each |jurism| release tracks the functionality
of Zotero, and code is checked against over 1,200 test fixtures
inherited from the parent project, plus a few additional tests of the
saving, editing, and synchronization of multilingual content.

The links here provide a view of the changes made to Zotero and
|jurism| at each tag release of the client, as extracted from the
commit logs of the project on `GitHub
<https://github.com/juris-m/zotero>`_.
