Zotero are beginning to convert the user interface to `React`_, in
preparation for migrating their code base away from Firefox to a new
home in `Electron`_. The conversion is already happening, and the
Preferences panel is `the next target in their roadmap`__.  The
current language preferences panel is Jurism is not intuitive to work
with, and intimidating to new users. The React migration will be an
opportunity to refashion it in a more inviting form. I could really
use some help on this one.

Current plan

There isn't much of one at the moment, but I'm thinking that sort of
drag-and-drop selector, with samples of a full citation and
bibliography entry in original, transliterated, and translated form,
elements of which can be dragged into rendering slots, might be easier
for people to understand and work with. But the details of that will
need to be worked out, and it will need to be coded.

Seriously, this is going to need more hands than my own.
