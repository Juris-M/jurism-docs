------------------------

|jurism| is a variant of Zotero that adds adds support for legal writing
and multilingual research. As far as I know, it is the only reference
manager that properly supports these areas of scholarship.

The aim in development is to make only the minimal changes necessary
to support legal and multilingual referencing. This reduces the effort
required to maintain the project, and holds open the possibility that
Zotero itself may one day merge some or all of the functionality
offered by |jurism|.

A consequence of the &ldquo;minimal changes&rdquo; approach is that
|jurism| plays well with existing Zotero systems. |jurism| does not
affect an existing Zotero database when installed, but instead creates
a copy of the Zotero original; and its libraries can be synced to the
user's existing Zotero account.

The project began life in 2010 as the "Multilingual
Zotero" plugin for the Firefox browser (MLZ). When changes to
Firefox announced in 2015 threatened to make plugin distribution more
difficult, the project was rebranded as "Juris-M," and
for a few months the client was distributed as a standalone program
only. It is currently offered both in standalone form (JM Standalone)
and as a browser plugin (JM for Firefox).

Zotero itself is poised for some major transformations, with largely
rewritten versions of the Firefox plugin and Standalone clients due
out later this year, followed by a planned migration to a new platform
independent of Firefox. |jurism| will follow these developments.
